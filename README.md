# Adil Ali


I am a biracial surfer with a keen interest in software design and a strong desire to create beautiful code. I am not just seeking a job, I am looking for a challenge and an opportunity to express my creativity. I am excited by the diversity and fast pace of the tech industry, and want to make my mark by finding solutions and coming up with new ideas. I want to work alongside compassionate and hardworking people who share my love for pragmatic design and code craftsmanship. **I'm available 16th May, 2016**

Skills
----
***


** Experiential learner ** :
* One of my biggest strengths is my speed and style of learning new things. I dive into a subject and immerse myself within it, putting the knowledge that I gain into use immediately. I like to understand something from my own volition, and I want to further my personal development by working with and learning from great developers.

* I lived in Russia for a little over a year, picking up the (very difficult) language within the first three months. I achieved this by immersing myself in the culture and by constantly learning new phrases and putting them into practice immediately.

* I taught myself Java and built an android app in the space of four days. I managed this by creating small programs, getting past obstacles by research and using the documentation. I firmly believe in learning by doing.

** Compassionate Communicator **  
* At Makers Academy, students are constantly pair-programming whenever they are working on a project. I quickly understood that communication was vital to work effectively and efficiently; writing good code meant you had to listen actively, and communicate problems and thought processes clearly. Working in teams of four, we also needed to make sure that everyone was on the same page constantly, which meant daily stand-ups.

* I care a lot about understanding people and making sure they understand me. During my time at Makers, I spent a lot of time helping junior students with their work, something that I was able to do by actively listening to their problems and using questions to help them see their problem from a different perspective.

** Curiosity ** :
* I am inquisitive and curious about everything tech-related, whether it's technologies or design patterns. I've always been driven by understanding how things work, and how they are designed. During my time at Makers, I experimented with a lot of frameworks that were not on the curriculum, such as MeteorJS and WebSockets.
